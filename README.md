# Competitive Programming

[Competitive Programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Competitive_programming) is a mind sport where contestants write programs to solve precisely specified algorithmic problems within strict constraints. Problems can range from simple ones that can be solved by any software developer and require little code to get a correct solution, to complex ones that require knowledge of special algorithms, data structures, and lots of practice. Coding interviews are similar is some respects as well.

Following is a curated lisiting of competitive programming competitions and related training resources.

### Some General Tips

Here, are some useful tips that you should know before getting started with Competitive programming:

- It's vital that you select a programming language which you are most comfortable with.
- Sign up on any online coding challenge website and start solving their practice problems.
- You need to deep understanding of various data structures which is vital to solving complex coding issues. You should know where to use which one.
- Have a solid understanding of the concept of time/space complexity in programs.
- Learn important programming patterns like recursion, dynamic programming, backtracking etc.
